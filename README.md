# Dynamic-Memory
Assignment 9.1: Mega Tic-Tac-Toe!
Description
Implement a tic-tac-toe game such that it allows for a board of any size. This game should support two players who take turns entering moves through the console.

Specifications:

The board can be of square size 3 x 3 or greater. This should defined by the user when the program first loads.
Player 1 should be represented as an X; Player 2 should be represented as an O.
Win condition does NOT scale with the size of the board. A player only needs to reach three in a row (diagonal, horizontal, or vertical) to win.
The player input is handled by taking two integer valuesâ€”one for the row number and the second for the column number of where to make their move.
At the end of the game, the player should be displayed with a win message.
Requirements:

Create a Visual Studio project. Naming convention for project: [yourlastname]_9
Create mega_tic_tac_toe.cpp file in the new project.
Project must build and compile without any errors.
Must meet runtime specifications from above.
Use new/delete to dynamically allocate the game board.
Use functions to logically organize code and maximize code reuse.
Use of a loop to handle player input and displaying the board.
Use proper code formatting and style, as well as correct variable naming practices.
Purpose
Get a working understanding of dynamic memory.

Tools
A PC computer or laptop
Microsoft Windows
Visual Studio Community Edition
